# py-timescale-lqr
A Python implemenation of the LPEG on time scales. 

`DiscreteLQR.py` is an implementation of a discrete LQR. No time scales involved! This was a preliminary attempt to creating the full LQPEG on any arbitrary time scale.

`KinematicsExample` was a numerical example for the discrete LQR for a system modelling kinematics.

`discreteLQPEG.py` is an implementation of the LQPEG on any discrete time scale. This is the main product of NASA West Virginia Space Grant Consortium, Training Grant #80NSSC20M0055.
